# Hangman_Game

Enjoy a game of hangman with a farm twist!  

## Technology Overview:
This application employs a variety of technologies, including:  HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and JQuery.  

## Instructions:  

The application can be viewed at this website:  https://hidden-oasis-18453.herokuapp.com/.  

Upon entering the application, first time users are asked to create a new user and returning users are asked to provide their log-in credentials.  

One the user is logged in, the user can access the items on their individualized NexTime to-do lists.  If the user has no items on the list, the user will be redirected to an interface where the user can create to-do items through entering the task, selecting a corresponding category for that task, and adding any notes that the user has associated with that task.  

Once the list is populated, the user has a variety of display options.  The default is the list in its entirety, but if the uses clicks on the category icon next to the task name, the user can view all items in that category.  By clicking on the icon to the right of the task name, the user can view the item in detail and make any updates to that item.  By clicking on the task name, the user can mark the task as complete, and by clicking on the delete icon, the user can delete items from the to-do list.  

Once NexTime identifies places of business in the area where a user can complete one or more items on their list, the application will send a modal alert to the user indicating the places within a certain distance from the user.
